# Easy Twitter

Easy Twitter is a mini social network that allows users to follow interesting pages. The app has two main routes: the home page and the tweets page. If the user tries to access a route that doesn't exist, they will be redirected to the home page.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
